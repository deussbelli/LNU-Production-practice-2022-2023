# Testing and Debugging

At the moment, design testing is temporarily postponed for the following reason: there is no ready-made layout of the site.

As soon as the site layout is completed and available for use, we will immediately begin testing the design. This page will provide information about the progress of testing, as well as any deficiencies identified and recommendations for eliminating them. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delay in testing and thank you for your patience. We will soon be able to provide you with a more complete picture of the site's design and quality.
