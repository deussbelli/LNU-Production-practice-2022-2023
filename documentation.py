#~ Overview
# This documentation explains the purpose, usage, and structure of the `LogIn` component in a React application. The `LogIn` component is responsible for rendering a login form, handling user input, and making a POST request to a server for user authentication.

#~ Usage
# The `LogIn` component is designed to be used within a React application to allow users to log in. To integrate this component into your application, follow these steps:

#~ 1. Import the `LogIn` component into your application:
#    ```javascript
#    import LogIn from './path/to/LogIn';
#    ```

#~ 2. Use the `LogIn` component within your application, typically in a route or view where user login is required.
#    ```javascript
#    function App() {
#      return (
#        <div>
#          {/* Other components and routes */}
#          <LogIn />
#          {/* Other components and routes */}
#        </div>
#      );
#    }
#    ```

#~ 3. Ensure that you have set up React Router and other dependencies as required by this component, as indicated by the import statements.

#~ Component Description
# The `LogIn` component consists of a login form that collects user input for email and password. It also performs client-side input validation, displays error messages, and sends a POST request to a server for authentication.

#~ Component State
# - `showPassword` (boolean): Determines whether the password field should display the entered text.
# - `userData` (object): An object that holds user data, including `email` and `password`.
# - `formData` (object): An object that holds form data, including `userEmail` and `userPassword`.
# - `formErrors` (object): An object that holds form validation error messages for `email` and `password`.

#~ Component Functions
# - `handleChange(event)`: Handles input changes in the form fields and performs client-side validation for email and password inputs.
# - `handleSubmit(event)`: Handles the form submission, validates user input, sends a POST request to the server for authentication, and displays success or error messages.

#~ Dependencies
# The `LogIn` component depends on the following external packages and files:
# - React (imported as `React`)
# - `useState` from React
# - `Link` and `useNavigate` from React Router
# - `axios` for making HTTP requests
# - Validation functions (`validatePassword`, `validateName`, and `validateEmail`) from "../FormValidtion's/validation's"
# - `toast` and `Toaster` from "react-hot-toast" for displaying toast notifications
# - `loginStyles` from "../../styles/AuthStyles/LogIn.module.css" for styling
# - `PORT` from "../constants" for specifying the server's URL
# - `preRequestFormChecker` from "./preRequestCheck" for additional form validation

#~ Component Structure
# The `LogIn` component is structured as follows:
# - The component starts with importing necessary dependencies and functions.
# - It defines the component function `LogIn` and sets up state variables using the `useState` hook.
# - The `handleChange` function is defined to handle input changes and validation.
# - The `handleSubmit` function is defined to handle form submission and send a POST request to the server.
# - The component renders a form with email and password fields and displays validation error messages.
# - The `Toaster` component from "react-hot-toast" is used to display toast notifications.

#~ Example Usage
# Here's an example of how the `LogIn` component can be used within a React application:
# ```javascript
# import React from 'react';
# import LogIn from './LogIn';
# function App() {
#   return (
#     <div>
#       {/* Other components and routes */}
#       <LogIn />
#       {/* Other components and routes */}
#     </div>
#   );
# }
# export default App;
# ```

# By integrating the `LogIn` component into your application, users can log in and access your protected content.

###############################################################
# At the moment, design testing is temporarily postponed for the following reason: 
# there is no ready-made layout of the site. An important step in design testing is the ability to view 
# and evaluate the design on a live website to determine its effectiveness, functionality, and visual impact on users.

# As soon as the site layout is completed and available for use, we will immediately begin testing the design. 
# This page will provide information about the progress of testing, as well as any deficiencies identified and recommendations 
# for eliminating them. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delay in testing and thank you for your patience. 
# We will soon be able to provide you with a more complete picture of the site's design and quality.
